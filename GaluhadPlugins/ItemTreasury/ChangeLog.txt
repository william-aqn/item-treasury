v.33.0.5

- Added a jump forward/backwards 10 pages button to the main window.
- Added sort options for results. They can now be sorted by item name or ID and in ascending or descending order.

v.32.0.2
- New Feature: Item favourites! Bookmark items you refer back to often, and list them with the new 'Favourites' option in the dropdown menu.
- Database updated to latest game version. The plugin automatically erases saved scans that match the new database. Some saved scans may have skipped database versions and remain by mistake, a delete button has been added to manually remove these from your saved items database.
- Item scanner will now ignore all instances of GNDN items.
- Added some new missing categories.

v.25.4.2
- New feature: Item and skill scanner. This scans live game data to find new items that have not yet been added to the plugin, these can be saved automatically into a new Saved 
  Items database for future reference and searching. This will allow the plugin to be used alongside new game updates without needing an official update first.
- Scanner will also show skills that it finds, this is more for developer reference for other plugins. Note that limitations in the API prevent auto-generating skill name so it will
  have to be noted manually outside the plugin.
- Items found in the scanner have a share icon which will print the item ID and name to the chat console.
- Saved scanned items will automatically be removed from save once added to the official plugin database.
- Added a desktop icon to easier access the plugin window instead of using the command. This icon can be dragged to reposition on the screen, and double clicked to open the window.
